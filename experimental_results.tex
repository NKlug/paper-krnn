In the following we are going to present some experimental results of the algorithm. The experiments where conducted for several instances of TSPLIB \cite{REINELT1995}, symmetric as well as asymmetric.

It can be observed that the results of $2$-RNN are only slightly better than those of $1$-RNN, sometimes they are even equal.
Considering that a $2$-RNN run for an instance with 1379 vertices (namely TSPLIB's \texttt{nrw1379}) takes about \red{XX} minutes while a $1$-RNN run for the same instance only takes \red{xx} minutes, the quality of the solution does not increase enough to justify the running time.
In general, this makes $2$-RNN less preferable than $1$-RNN since they almost give the same result.
