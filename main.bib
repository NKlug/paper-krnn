	abstract = { This paper contains the description of a traveling salesman problem library (TSPLIB) which is meant to provide researchers with a broad set of test problems from various sources and with various properties. For every problem a short description is given along with known lower and upper bounds. Several references to computational tests on some of the problems are given. INFORMS Journal on Computing, ISSN 1091-9856, was published as ORSA Journal on Computing from 1989 to 1995 under ISSN 0899-1499. }

	abstract = {This paper discusses a highly effective heuristic procedure for generating optimum and near-optimum solutions for the symmetric traveling-salesman problem. The procedure is based on a general approach to heuristics that is believed to have wide applicability in combinatorial optimization problems. The procedure produces optimum solutions for all problems tested, 'classical' problems appearing in the literature, as well as randomly generated test problems, up to 110 cities. Run times grow approximately as n2; in absolute terms, a typical 100-city problem requires less than 25 seconds for one case (GE635), and about three minutes to obtain the optimum with above 95 per cent confidence.},

	abstract = {The traveling-salesman problem is a generalized form of the simple problem to find the smallest closed loop that connects a number of points in a plane. Efforts in the past to find an efficient method for solving it have met with only partial success. The present paper describes a method of solution that has the following properties: (a) It is applicable to both symmetric and asymmetric problems with random elements. (b) It does not use subjective decisions, so that it can be completely mechanized. (c) It is appreciably faster than any other method proposed. (d) It can be terminated at any point where the solution obtained so far is deemed sufficiently accurate.},
