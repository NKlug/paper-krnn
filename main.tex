\title{$k$-RNN: Extending NN-heuristics for the TSP}

	\maketitle
	\begin{abstract}
		In this paper we present an extension of existing Nearest-Neighbor heuristics to an algorithm called $k$-Repetitive-Nearest-Neighbor. 
		The idea is to start with a tour of $k$ nodes and then perform a Nearest-Neighbor search from there on. 
		After doing this for all permutations of $k$ nodes the result gets selected as the shortest tour found. 
		Experimental results show that for $2$-RNN the solutions quality remains relatively stable between about $10\%$ to $40\%$ above the optimum.

	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:introduction}
	The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the most studied problems in theoretical computer science. 
	Despite its simplicity, no efficient algorithms exist. 
	The problem is, in fact, NP-hard and asks to find a shortest Hamiltonian Cycle in a given graph -- a permutation of vertices for which the sum of the connecting edges is the least.
	We refer to the TSP in undirected complete graphs as Symmetric TSP (STSP) and in directed complete graphs as Asymmetric TSP (ATSP).
	Following a popular convention for TSP-related algorithms, we will also refer to a Hamiltonian cycle as a tour. 	

	Due to the problem's popularity and its broad area of application, many heuristics and approximation algorithms have emerged. One of the popular ones are the $2$-Opt heuristic \cite{CROES1958}, the $3$-Opt algorithm \cite{LIN1965} and the $k$-opt extension by Lin and Kernigham \cite{LIN1973} which uses a dynamic $k$ value.
	
	The idea behind the algorithm which is presented here is the "Nearest-Neighbor" heuristic (NN).
	It has already been mentioned in the 1960s by Bellmore and Nemhauser \cite{BELLMORE1968}.
	The basic idea of this algorithm is to pick one starting node randomly and repeatedly extend the sub-tour by its current nearest neighbor until a full tour is formed.
	
	$k$-Repetitive-Nearest-Neighbor ($k$-RNN), the algorithm presented here, provides some abstraction and generalization to this Nearest-Neighbor heuristic. 
	It is applicable to both STSP and ATSP and the experimental results in Section \ref{sec:experimental} do not show a big difference in quality of solution between those two.
	
	The original idea for this extension of Nearest-Neighbor heuristics was what now has become $2$-RNN. It was inspired by an Indian philosophy called Madhyasth Darshan \cite{Nagraj2011, Nagraj2013}. 
	
	In Section \ref{sec:algorithm} we present the algorithm and show some of its properties, then we show some related work. 
	In Section \ref{sec:experimental} we show experimental results for $1$- and $2$-RNN obtained from running some samples form TSPLIB \cite{REINELT1995}.

	\section{Related Work}
	\label{sec:related}
	
	Similar to Gutin, Yeo and Zverovich in their domination analysis of greedy heuristics for the TSP \cite{GUTIN2002}, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we define the \textit{domination number} of an algorithm for the TSP as the maximum integer $d(n)$ for which the algorithm produces a tour that is better or equal than $d(n)$ other tours.
	 
	
	In general the Nearest-Neighbor approach has been shown to be sub optimal \cite{GUTIN2002}: 
	For each number of nodes there exist some instances for which the algorithm produces a very poor result.
	In fact, the domination number for $0$-RNN is 1, the worst possible domination number.
	$1$-RNN has a domination number of at most $n - 1$ and at least $n / 2$.
	As shown in theorem \ref{theo:quality}, every run of the algorithm for $k \geq 1$ considers all tours a $1$-RNN run for the same instance does.
	Therefore for $k \geq 1$, $k$-RNN also has a domination number of at least $n / 2$.
	
	Despite this all samples tested in our experiments in Section \ref{sec:experimental} produce reasonable results.

	\section{Conclusion}
	\label{sec:conclusion}
	
	We presented an extension of the already known Nearest-Neighbor heuristic to a family of algorithms we call $k$-Repetitive-Nearest-Neighbor ($k$-RNN). 
	This algorithm takes all permutations of $k$ vertices as a starting tour and performs a Nearest-Neighbor search from there on. 
	The result is the shortest of all tours found that way.
	
	We have proven that as $k$ increases, so does the quality of the tours found.
	Despite this, our experimental results only show a slight increase in the quality of solution as $k$ increases, meanwhile the running time increases by a factor of $n$.
	In one case a larger $k$ ($2$-RNN) was able to avoid an undesirable result from $1$-RNN, reducing the excess by over 350\%.
	
	
	A scope of future research could be a more thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithm, especially an extension of the domination analysis to the more general $k$-RNN will give more insight in its competitiveness among other algorithms.
