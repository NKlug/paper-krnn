	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:introduction}
	The traveling salesman problem is one of the most studied problems in Theoretical Computer Science. 
	Despite its simplicity, no efficient algorithms exist. 
	Thus a lot of heuristics and approximation algorithms have emerged, some are more simple like GR and NN, some are more complicated like the Lin-Kernigham heuristic \cite{LIN1973}.
	
	Readers might find a strong relation between the algorithm and the well-known Nearest-Neighbor and the Repetitive-Nearest-Neighbor heuristics. 
	In fact, we extend those algorithms to a more general basis.

	\section{Related Work}
	\label{sec:related}
	
	As Gutin, Yeo and Zverovich have shown \cite{GUTIN2002}, the Nearest-Neighbor approach in general is sub optimal: 
	For each number of nodes there exist some instances for which the algorithm produces a very poor result. 
	Despite this all samples tested in our experiments in Section \ref{sec:experimental} produce reasonable results.
	
	What else?
	\section{Experimental Results}
	\label{sec:experimental}
	
	In the following we are going to present some experimental results of the algorithm. The experiments where conducted for several instances of TSPLIB \cite{REINELT1995}, symmetric as well as asymmetric.

	Results show that the quality is most of the time only increasing by a tiny portion.
