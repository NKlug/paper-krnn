	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:introduction}
	The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the most studied problems in theoretical computer science. 
	Despite its simplicity, no efficient algorithms exist. 
	The problem is, in fact, NP-hard and asks to find a shortest Hamiltonian Cycle in a given graph.
	We refer to the TSP in undirected complete graphs as Symmetric TSP (STSP) and in directed complete graphs as Asymmetric TSP (ATSP).

	\red{Definition: Tour}

	Due to the problem's popularity and its broad area of application, many heuristics and approximation algorithms have emerged. One of the popular ones are the $2$-Opt heuristic \cite{CROES1958}, the $3$-Opt algorithm \cite{LIN1965} and the $k$-opt extension by Lin and Kernigham \cite{LIN1973} which uses a dynamic value.
	
	The idea behind the algorithm which is presented here is based on is the "Nearest Neighbor" heuristic (NN).
	It has already been mentioned in the 1960s (\red{TODO: Check if this is true}) by Bellmore and Nemhauser \cite{BELLMORE1968}.
	The basic idea of this algorithm is to pick one starting node randomly and repeatedly extend the sub-tour by its current nearest neighbor until a tour is formed.
	
	The algorithm we present provides some abstraction and generalization to this Nearest Neighbor heuristic. 
	It is applicable to both STSP and ATSP and the experimental results in Section \ref{sec:experimental} do not show a big difference in quality of solution between those two.
	
	In Section \ref{sec:algorithm} we present the algorithm and show some of its properties, then we show some related work. 
	In Section \ref{sec:experimental} we show some experimental results obtained from running some samples form TSPLIB \cite{REINELT1995}.

	\section{Related Work}
	\label{sec:related}
	
	Similar to Gutin, Yeo and Zverovich \cite{GUTIN2002}, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we define the \textit{domination number} of an algorithm for the TSP as the maximum integer $d(n)$ for which the algorithm produces a tour that is better or equal than $d(n)$ other tours.
	 
	
	In general the Nearest-Neighbor approach has been shown to be sub optimal \cite{GUTIN2002}: 
	For each number of nodes there exist some instances for which the algorithm produces a very poor result.
	In fact, the domination number for $0$-RNN is 1, the worst possible domination number.
	$1$-RNN has a domination number of at most $n - 1$ and at least $n / 2$.
	As shown in theorem \ref{theo:quality}, every run of the algorithm for $k \geq 1$ considers all tours a $1$-RNN run for the same instance does.
	
	
	\red{TBD: Own domination number proof?}
	
	Despite this all samples tested in our experiments in Section \ref{sec:experimental} produce reasonable results.
	
	\red{What else?}

	\section{Conclusion}
	\label{sec:conclusion}
	
	We presented an extension of the already known Nearest Neighbor heuristic to a family of algorithms we call $k$-Repetitive-Nearest-Neighbor ($k$-RNN). 
	This algorithm takes all permutations of $k$ vertices as a starting tour and performs a Nearest Neighbor search from there on. 
	The result is the shortest of all tours found that way.
	
	As $k$ increases our experiments only show a slight increase in the quality of solution whereas the running time increases by a factor of $n$.
	Therefore
	
	A scope of future research could be a more thorough theoretical analysis of the algorithm, especially a extension of the domination analysis to the more general $k$-RNN will give more insight in its competitiveness among other algorithms.
